# 💻 Laptop Reviews EDA & Outlier Removal

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **outlier detection** using a dataset of laptop reviews. By applying visualization techniques and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, we uncover insights and clean the data for reliable further analysis or modeling.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Correlation Heatmap**
   - Shows relationships between numerical features.
2. **Boxplot Visualizations**
   - Highlights the distribution and detects outliers visually.
3. **IQR-Based Outlier Detection**
   - Identifies extreme values statistically using the Interquartile Range method.
4. **Outlier Removal**
   - Filters data to create a cleaned dataset.
